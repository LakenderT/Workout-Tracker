# Workout Tracker

## Objective

Build an exercise tracking app using natural language processing and Google sheets.

You **won't** be able to run this solution code as is. Why? You'll need to add **your own** API keys as environment variables first.
## FAQ Sheety: Insufficient Permission

Sheety needs permission to access your Google Sheet. When you sign into Sheety you probably forgot to give it permission. Sign out of Sheety and sign in again. Also, go to your Google Account -> Security -> Third Party Apps with Account Access. Check that you see Sheety listed there.
